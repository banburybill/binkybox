## The Problem

Windows 10 [introduced virtual desktop support in 2015](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1936035/virtual-desktops-more-space-and-order-with-windows-10-and-11.html). This led to the obsolescence of third-party virtual desktop software, which is a problem, since Windows's native virtual desktop support lacks two very important features:

1. Ability to hop from one desktop to another directly without going through intermediate desktops in between (for example, going straight from desktop 1 to desktop 3) via keyboard shortcuts.
2. Ability to see which desktop you're on right now thanks to a system tray icon.

Indeed, Windows 11 only comes with two shortcuts for navigating virtual desktops:

- _Win+Ctrl+ü†ä_: Switch a desktop to the right.
- _Win+Ctrl+ü†à_: Switch a desktop to the left.

Not only is this ridiculous, but there's no way to add additional shortcuts without writing code that calls Windows's exposed COM API directly.

## The Solution!

**BinkyBox** lets you _hop_ from one desktop to another via keyboard shortcuts and adds a useful system tray icon so you know which desktop you're on. The logo is a cute bunny because bunnies hop. Like you're hopping from one desktop to another. Using keyboard shortcuts. Let's all hop together using BinkyBox.

A "binky" is a word for [a kind of happy hop that bunnies do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ivoIr_xnQ).

### Incredible Features:

- Hop from one virtual desktop to another _directly_ using incredible keyboard shortcuts.
- See which virtual desktop you're on right now via a system tray icon.
- Written in Rust, leading to very low (almost nonexistent) background resource usage.

I may add other features later.

## Tested Platforms

| Windows            | Tested     |
|--------------------|------------|
| Windows 11 23H2    | ‚úîÔ∏è         |

## Build and Use

### Download the App

You can get pre-build binaries from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nadimkobeissi/binkybox/releases) page.

### Compile it Yourself

You will need to have [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nadimkobeissi/binkybox
cd binkybox
cargo build --release
```

The `.exe` will be in `target/release`.

## Setting Keyboard Shortcuts

Right click the tray icon and open _Settings_ in order to set your own keyboard shortcuts. BinkyBox keyboard shortcuts follow this layout: `MODIFIER+OPTIONAL_MODIFIER+OPTIONAL_MODIFIER+OPTIONAL_MODIFIER+ALPHANUMERIC_CHAR`.

The first modifier is required, and ending the sequence with an alphanumeric character is also required.

- **Supported Modifiers**: `CAPSLOCK`, `LCTRL`, `RCTRL`, `LALT`, `RALT`, `LWIN`, `RWIN`, `LSHIFT`, `RSHIFT`
- **Example Keyboard Shortcuts**: `LCTRL+LALT+1`, `CAPSLOCK+1`, `LWIN+LSHIFT+1`

BinkyBox will reject keyboard shortcuts not specified using the layout above, so make sure you enter your keyboard shortcuts correctly. Keyboard shortcuts (and other settings) will be saved in a `binkybox.config.json` file located in the same directory as the BinkyBox executable.

## Adding to Windows Startup

You can make BinkyBox start automatically on Windows startup when you log in:

1. Create a shortcut for `binkybox.exe` by right-clicking it.
2. Press _Win+R_ to open Run, and type in `shell:common startup`.
3. Paste the BinkyBox shortcut you created in Step 1 inside the resulting Startup folder.
